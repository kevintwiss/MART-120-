        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        <p></p>
        <h1>Kevin Twiss</h1>

        <p>The rain was falling heavily. It was like driving through a thick curtain of water. He eased off the accelerator a little. Had to be careful driving on wild nights like these.</p>
	<p>The last thing youâ€™d want is to have an accident or breakdown. You just want to be at home on these stormy nights. The thwack-thwack of the windscreen wipers was hypnotic.</p>
	<p>The storm was terrible and a man stopped on the side of a road to pick up a hitchhiker.</p>
	<p>The man was completely soaked.....but the mystery remained. Who was he? Where was he going? Why was he there?</p>
